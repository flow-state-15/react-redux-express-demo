This file maps our state shape and paths we'll need in reducer
Start at top level of state:


state: {
    sessions: {},
    gif: {},
    posts: {}
}

--> state.posts
posts: {
    id: {},
    all_posts: []
}

--> state.posts[id]
posts[id] = {
    id: Number,
    content: String,
    comments: {}
}

--> state.posts[id].comments
comments = {
    id: {},
    all: [comment, comment]
}

--> state.posts[id].comments[id]
comments[id] = {
    id: Number,
    post_id: Number,
    content: String,
    subcomments: {}
}

--> state.posts[id].comments[id].subcomments
subcomments = {
    id: {},
    all: []
}

--> state.posts[id].comments[id].subcomments[id]
subcomments[id] = {
    id: Number,
    comment_id: Number,
    content: String,
}
